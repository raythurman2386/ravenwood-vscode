## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! I'd love to hear from you whether it's a bug report, a feature request, or feedback on the colors.

Please note: I am quite colorblind. These colors work nicely for me, but if you notice any oddities, it's likely I just can't see them! I don't usually notice small tweaks, so if something looks "off," please reach out. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
